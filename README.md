# Recursive Maze Solver

This program is designed to solve mazes represented in text files using a recursive algorithm. The mazes it solves are composed of 4 different characters, "X" for walls, " " for movable space, "+" for the starting position, and "-" for the ending position. In addition, a line is above the very maze that consists of two sets of numbers representing the number of rows and columns respectively.
